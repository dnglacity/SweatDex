v1.12 02.28.2026 2123 Jersey number uniqueness warning
- Added: Jersey number uniqueness warning in add_player_screen — when typing a jersey number already assigned to another player on the team, a non-blocking orange warning appears below the field
- Added: PlayerService.getJerseyNumbers(teamId) — lightweight DB query returning all non-null jersey numbers for a team as an uppercase Set<String>
- Changed: In edit mode, the player's own current jersey is excluded from the taken set so editing it back to the same value does not trigger a false warning

v1.12 02.28.2026 Quality of life improvements
- Added: Pencil (edit) icon on each roster player row between the attendance icon and the menu icon — opens AddPlayerScreen in edit mode directly without going through the popup menu
- Added: Duplicate option in the game roster inline menu (saved_roster_screen) — prompts for a new name pre-filled as "<original> (Copy)", validates uniqueness (case-insensitive) against existing rosters, copies starters/substitutes/starter_slots to a new row
- Added: PlayerService.duplicateGameRoster() — fetches source roster and inserts a new row with copied lineup data
- Changed: Set starter slots icon in game_roster_screen AppBar changed from tune to settings (gear)
- Changed: Gear icon now opens a popup menu with "Starter Slots" and "Change Date" options instead of directly opening the slot dialog
- Added: Change Date option in game roster settings menu — opens a dialog to set or clear the game date, persisted to the DB immediately via PlayerService.updateGameRosterMeta()
- Added: PlayerService.updateGameRosterMeta() — updates game_date on an existing roster row
- Added: lib/widgets/date_input_field.dart — reusable DateInputField widget with separate YYYY / MM / DD text boxes, auto-focus advancement, and a calendar icon that opens showDatePicker
- Changed: Game date input in New Game Roster dialog (saved_roster_screen) replaced with DateInputField
- Changed: Game date input in Change Date dialog (game_roster_screen) replaced with DateInputField with a dedicated Clear button

v1.12 02.28.2026 2044 Account settings improvements
- Added: "Sign Out" button in Account Settings screen
- Added: App version footer ("Apex On Deck v2.28.26") at the bottom of Account Settings
- Added: "Change Password" button in Account Settings screen
- Added: Password change dialog prompts for current password (verified via re-auth), new password, and confirmation — blocks update if new passwords do not match
- Added: AuthService.changePassword() re-authenticates then calls Supabase Auth updateUser() to set the new password
- Added: kAppVersion constant in main.dart

v1.12 02.28.2026 Game roster size saving and validation
- Fixed: Changing the roster size (starter slots) is now persisted when saving a game roster — `updateGameRosterLineup` includes `starter_slots` in the DB update
- Fixed: Loading a saved game roster now restores the saved starter slot count so the UI reflects the correct roster size
- Added: Saving a game roster is blocked if the number of starters exceeds the roster size — a dialog prompts the coach to bench/remove a starter or increase the roster size

v1.12 02.28.2026 Performance fixes
- Fixed: Stale in-memory team cache in PlayerService — added 5-minute TTL (_teamsCacheValid) to prevent stale data on long sessions or shared devices
- Fixed: Abandoned in-flight futures in ManageMembersScreen — replaced FutureBuilder + reassigned Future with state-driven pattern (_members, _isLoading, _loadError) and a generation counter to discard superseded results
- Fixed: Hardcoded 800ms retry delay for user ID resolution — replaced direct table query + fixed retry with SECURITY DEFINER RPC (get_current_user_id), eliminating the trigger-race concern entirely and removing the retry loop
- Fixed: Legacy name-split fallback in Player.fromMap() removed — migration is complete, _kPlayerColumns never selects the legacy name column so the code was unreachable dead code
- Fixed: Missing bounds validation in getPlayersPaginated() — added assert guards for from >= 0 and to >= from
- Fixed: Triple-allocation list chain in _mapPlayers() — replaced .cast().map().toList() with single-pass .map().toList() to eliminate intermediate CastList allocation

v1.12 02.28.2026 1840
- Added: Athlete Email field in edit mode on AddPlayerScreen (re-attempts account linking on save)
- Changed: CLAUDE.md build commands split into distinct Publish, Reset, and Debug workflows
- Changed: Commands.txt updated to clarify ship vs reset workflows
