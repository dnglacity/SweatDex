AOD v1.3

Edit tab name font colors on the game_roster_screen so they are White.

Once names are placed into either starting or bench, save those positions.
 
Supabase Realtime on game_rosters — Add a .stream() in SavedRosterScreen so roster changes made on another coach's device appear instantly.

RPC for add_player_account — The auto-link trigger handles new players; add an RPC so coaches can manually link existing players to accounts retroactively from the ManageCoachesScreen.

Player self-view screen — Once a player logs in and sees their team with the "PLAYER" badge, give them a read-only view of their own attendance record and list of teammates.

Offline support — Cache game_rosters and players locally and sync on reconnect — useful for coaches in gyms with poor signal.
coaches.email column — Verify this column exists; addCoachToTeam() and the email-link trigger both query against it. If it's missing, add ALTER TABLE coaches ADD COLUMN email text; and backfill from auth.users.
