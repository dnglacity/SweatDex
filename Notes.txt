AOD v1.4

Change the link to player function to be automatic when editing or adding player rather than a separate manual task.

TabBarView lazy loading — Both tabs in GameRosterScreen build immediately. Wrapping the body in IndexedStack or using AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin should prevent the available-players list from re-rendering every tab switch.

Pagination on players list; use .range() with an infinite scroll ListView.

For each player, add a position text field.

Allow coaches to temporarily edit positions on the game roster screen
