add a join team option in the team selection screen. users will input a code from the team's coaches.
create these roles: player, assistant coach, team manager, parents, Parent lead
Coaches can generate a random 7 character code, each for a specific role to prevent assigning incorrect roles.

SportAutocompleteField — pre-fetch once at app startup — getSports() is currently called every time a dialog opens in roster_screen.dart. Lift it to app state (e.g., a Provider) and load it once on login.

guardian_links table — currently linkGuardianToPlayer() exists but the guardian_links_select RLS policy lets guardians see their linked player rows. A future "Guardian View" screen (similar to PlayerSelfViewScreen) could give parents a read-only view of their athlete's status across teams.

Index on players.athlete_email and players.guardian_email — the new change_user_email RPC does full-table scans on both columns. Add indexes:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_athlete_email  ON public.players (lower(athlete_email));
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_guardian_email ON public.players (lower(guardian_email));



Optimizations
A. Replace FutureBuilder with StreamBuilder on TeamSelectionScreen
_teamsFuture is a Future refreshed manually by calling _refreshTeams(). The team list should behave like the game roster list — driven by a Supabase Realtime stream so changes made by other coaches (team renames, new members added) appear without a manual pull-to-refresh. [Inference] This would require adding a getTeamStream() method to PlayerService mirroring the existing getGameRosterStream() pattern.
B. Move the is_team_member / is_team_owner check inside the DB for deleteTeam and removeMemberFromTeam
Currently player_service.dart calls _isTeamOwner() (a round-trip) before calling the actual delete — two round-trips total. The ownership check should be enforced entirely by RLS so the Dart layer only needs to make one call and handle a permission error.
C. Add get_my_team_ids() as an index-backed materialized or cached query
[Inference] On rosters with 50+ teams, every SELECT on players or team_members invokes get_my_team_ids() per row evaluated by Postgres. A partial index CREATE INDEX idx_team_members_user_id ON team_members(user_id) (if not already present) would ensure this subquery is an index-only scan.
