add a join team option in the team selection screen. users will input a code from the team's coaches.

SportAutocompleteField — pre-fetch once at app startup — getSports() is currently called every time a dialog opens in roster_screen.dart. Lift it to app state (e.g., a Provider) and load it once on login.

guardian_links table — currently linkGuardianToPlayer() exists but the guardian_links_select RLS policy lets guardians see their linked player rows. A future "Guardian View" screen (similar to PlayerSelfViewScreen) could give parents a read-only view of their athlete's status across teams.

Index on players.athlete_email and players.guardian_email — the new change_user_email RPC does full-table scans on both columns. Add indexes:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_athlete_email  ON public.players (lower(athlete_email));
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_guardian_email ON public.players (lower(guardian_email));
