## High Impact

1. Attendance History / Reports
   The app tracks attendance per session but has no way to view history. A simple attendance log per player (dates + statuses) would be very useful for coaches and parents.

2. Player Quick-Edit on Roster Row xx
   Currently editing a player requires navigating away. An inline edit bottom sheet (tap the player row) for jersey number, position, and status would save a lot of navigation.

3. Bulk Attendance Toggle xx
   "Mark all present" / "Mark all absent" buttons on the roster screen. Coaches shouldn't have to tap every player one-by-one at the start of practice.

4. Game Roster Reuse xx
   Allow loading a previously saved game roster as a starting point for a new one, rather than rebuilding from scratch every game.

## Medium Impact

5. Player Search/Filter on Roster
   With paginated loading, finding a specific player requires scrolling. A search bar or filter by position/status/grade would help.

6. Jersey Number Uniqueness Warning
   When adding/editing a player, warn if the jersey number is already taken on that team (not a hard block, just a warning).

7. Team Invite Link / QR Code
   Instead of manually entering emails in manage_members_screen, generate a shareable invite link or QR code for players/parents to self-join.

8. Position Sort on Game Roster
   In game_roster_screen, let coaches sort the lineup by position groupings (e.g., all guards together, all forwards together).

## Low Impact / Polish

9. Swipe-to-Cycle Status
   On the roster, swiping a player row could cycle through present → late → absent instead of needing the current dismiss gesture or menu.

10. Player Count Badge on Team Cards
    Show "(12 players)" on the team selection cards so coaches know roster size at a glance before entering.

11. Offline Indicator
    A subtle banner when the app is operating from cache (no connection) so users understand why data may be stale.

12. Grade Filter for Multi-Grade Teams
    Filter roster by grade (9th, 10th, etc.) — useful for coaches managing JV/varsity or multi-grade teams.
